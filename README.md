# CleanMyArea

**Welcome to CleanMyArea**, a revolutionary platform that transforms waste management into a seamless and rewarding experience! 🌍✨

In today’s world, effective waste disposal is more important than ever. CleanMyArea provides a user-friendly solution to help individuals, businesses, and communities segregate and manage waste efficiently, while promoting sustainability. ♻️

Our platform enables users to categorize waste into four key types:

- **Green Dustbin** for biodegradable waste 🟢
- **Blue Dustbin** for recyclable waste 🔵
- **Red Dustbin** for non-recyclable and hazardous waste (like medical waste) 🔴
- **Industry Waste Management** for handling industrial and large-scale waste effectively 🏭

## What Makes CleanMyArea Stand Out?

We not only simplify waste disposal but also offer financial incentives! By selling recyclable waste through our platform, users can earn money while contributing to a cleaner environment. 💰🌱
